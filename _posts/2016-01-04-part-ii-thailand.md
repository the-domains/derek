Hello, Thailand

Part II: Thailand is a continuation of our travels through Southeast Asia.

From Bali (Part I), we made our way to Thailand. The itinerary included: Phi Phi Don, Phi Phi Le, Ko Lanta, Ko Rok, and Ko Klang. Our scheduled flight to Krabi arrived too late in the evening to catch a ferry to Phi Phi Don, so we stayed a night at the Krabi Sheraton and coordinated our ferry ride for the morning.

Our top deck ferry seats provided little protection from the sun, but did provided for some nice scenery.

Ko Phi Phi Don

In 2004, Phi Phi Don was one of many landmasses devastated by the Indian Ocean Tsunami which affected 14 countries. Much of the islands infrastructure was destroyed. Had we not heard of the storm in the news prior, neither of us would have been able to guess the island had been recently rebuilt.
